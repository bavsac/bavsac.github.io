            I am Bavana and I love to create!<br /><br />I am a driven Software
            Developer with an eye for detail. <br /><br />As a mum of 2
            beautiful children, I have enjoyed spending my time bringing them up
            thouroughly so far. Now, they are in school and more independent, I
            decided I need new challenges and enrolled with Northcoders to
            reskill myself. I never realised how my computer science engineering
            background lay latent to be explored. <br />Northcoders Bootcamp has
            rekindled my love for programming while giving me the confidence to
            get back into coding and design. During the course of this program,
            I have had the opportunity to code with many different individuals,
            this has given me an opportunity to express my ideas and logic
            clearly as a navigator. It has also given me an understanding of the
            other person's views and asked for clarification while driving.
            <br /><br />
            I have learnt the value of patience and diplomatic communication
            after becoming a parent.<br /><br />
            Living in different parts of the world has given me an opportunity
            to experience new cultures and interact with people from all over
            the world. <br /><br />
            I love creating art for my family and friends. I have experimented
            with different paint mediums and work surfaces. I enjoy handbuilding
            pottery and sketching. <br /><br />
            Since I was a teenager, I have enjoyed cooking and baking. Living in
            different places has given me the opportunity to experience
            different local flavours and cusines. This inturn drives me to
            experiment with new flavour profiles.
